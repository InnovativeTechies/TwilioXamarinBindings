# Twilio Xamarin Bindings

Twilio Bindings for Xamarin apps

## How to Build

You will need Xamarin installed on a mac.  Run the following:

```
sh ./bootstrapper.sh -t libs
```

This will download the necessary cake tooling in a `./tools/` folder, download the external dependencies, and run the build scripts.
